		<p1><i>Due by Monday 4/20 11:59 PM PST</i></p1>
		<p>Instructions</p>
		<p2>Download <a href="../project_zips/project1.zip" download>project1.zip</a>.</p2>
		<p2><br>Submission:</p2>
		<p2><br>Grading: Projects are graded based on correctness. However, there is partial credit given for partially finished solutions;
		</p2>

		<p>Project Overview</p>
		<p2><br>In this project, you will be implementing a rudimentary version of Chess using Pygame. Pygame is a Python library that provides a lot of useful tools for rendering and implementing game mechanics.

		<p>Setting up</p>
		<p2><br>First, after you download the zip file, open it and move it into a place you're comfortable accessing (ex. Desktop or Documents folder on your computer). Then, using your terminal/command line, direct over to the folder and install Pygame by typing <b>pip install pygame</b>. (Note: If your version of Python is less that 3.7, this might not work. Make sure you have a newer version of Python3 installed).

		<p>Getting Familiar with the Files</p>
		When you open the folder, you will notice that there are three main files being used: <b>Board.py</b>, <b>chess.py</b>, and <b>Piece.py</b>. You will not need to look at Board.py as it has already been implemented for you. Most of your coding will be done on chess.py. The rest will be done on Piece.py. 

		<p>Project Questions</p>

		

		

		<p>Testing</p>
		<p2><br>Testing will be done manually by instructors. As long as your implementation fulfills all of the parameters listed in the doc, you will get 100% on your project.
