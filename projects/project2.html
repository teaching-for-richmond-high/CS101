		<p>Instructions</p>
		<p2><br>Submission:</p2>
		<p2><br>Grading: This project will be graded on effort. We encourage you to not think too hard about it and just pursue something you're interested in!
		</p2>

		<p>Project Overview</p>
		<p2><br>Congratulations! We're almost done with a semester of coding! In celebration of all of the new things we learned, we are going to make this project open ended. You can make whatever you want (granted, it has to be finish-able within the time frame given)! We will try to help you maneuver through planning and help you succeed to making your vision a reality!

		<p>Rules</p>
		<p2><br>Okay we lied a little bit. We will have to implement a few rules just to make sure that you get the most out of your learning experience.
		<p2><br><b>Rule 1:</b> You have to use Python or HTML/CSS for your project. 
		<p2><br><b>Rule 2:</b> Whatever it is that you're making, let's try to make it PG please (no expletives, no inappropriate material).
		<p2><br><b>Rule 3:</b> Have fun and enjoy yourself! Again, there's no pressure so make something as simple or as complex as you want...as long as it is within the time frame given! 

		
		<br>
		<br>
		<p2><br>If you're feeling a bit overwhelmed, don't worry! We will be devoting the whole last week of class to helping you plan and code your project. Additionally, we will be using lecture and discussion time to talk to each of you and figure out what it is you want to make and how we can make that happen! Again, if you have any concerns or questions, feel free to reach out to us! We are here to help you.
