<p class="teacher_text">Hello, I'm Augustine, and I graduated with a bachelor’s degree in mechanical engineering from the University of California, Berkeley. I have a passion for robotics. I have seven years of competition experience, including competing at the VEX Robotics World Championships four times. Before joining Starfire, I had worked with a variety of classroom settings including English classes in Taiwan, summer robotics camps in public school, and Sunday school at my church. Outside of engineering and teaching, I enjoys good food with good company, clever games, and trying out things with funny names.</p>
