		<p2><b>Note: Please be reminded that we will not actually be handing out grades. This is only to demonstrate how a typical undergraduate CS course would grade a class.</b></p>
		<p>Attendance/Participation(10%)</p>
		<p2><br>Grading: Attending all classes is mandatory for a complete grade. If you are unable to attend a class, please notify the staff 24 hours before class time. We will keep track of participation in class and during lab times and reward credit as we see fit. This will only boost your grade, not bring it down. 
		<p>Homeworks(30%)</p>
		<p2><br>Grading: Homework is graded based on effort, not correctness. However, there is no partial credit; you must show substantial effort on every problem to receive any points. This homework is out of 2 points. 
		</p2>
		<p>Labs(30%)</p>
		<p2><br>Grading: Labs are graded on correctness. Partial credit will not be rewarded for incomplete labs. Labs are graded by either receiving a 1 (complete) or a 0 (incomplete).
		</p2>
		<p>Projects(30%)</p>
		<p2><br>Grading: Projects are graded on completeness, although partial credit will be rewarded for incomplete projects. Make sure to review project specs for a complete rundown of point distribution.
