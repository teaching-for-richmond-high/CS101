	<header>Homework 3: Getting Started</header>
	<div class="main">
		<p1><i>Due by Friday 3/23 11:59 PM PST</i></p1>
		<p>Instructions</p>
		<p2>Download <a href="../hw_zips/hw03.zip" download>hw03.zip</a>.</p2>
		<p2><br>Submission:</p2>
		<p2><br>Grading: Homework is graded based on effort, not correctness. However, there is no partial credit; you must show substantial effort on every problem to receive any points. This homework is out of 2 points. 
		</p2>
		<p>Homework Questions</p>

		<p2><br><b>Problem 1: G</b></p2>
		<p2><br>Return the value of g(n), computed recursively.  

		<p2><br><br><b>Problem 2: Has Seven</b></p2>
		<p2><br>Given a list of integers, return whether or not the list contains a 7 in it. Hint: remember you can use for loops to iterate through lists.

		<p2><br><br><b>Problem 3: Is Palindrome</b></p2>
		<p2><br>Given a number in the form of a string, return whether or not the number is a palindrome aka whether or not the number is the same if it's reversed.

		<p2><br><br><b>Problem 4: Count Change</b></p2>
		<p2><br>Once the machines take over, the denomination of every coin will be a power of 2: 1-cent, 2-cent, 4-cent, 8-cent, etc. There will be no limit to how much a coin can be worth. 
		<p2><br>A set of coins makes changes for n if the sum of the values of the coin is n. For example, the following sets make change for 7: 7 1-cent coins, 5 1-cent and 1 2-cent coins, 3 1-cent and 1 4-cent coins, 1 1-cent and 3 2-cent coins, 1 1-cent, 1 2-cent, and 1 4-cent coins. There are a total of 6 different ways.
		<p2><br>Write a function count_change that takes a positive integer n and returns the number of ways to make change from using these coins of the future.

		

		<p>Testing</p>
		<p2><br>Testing will be done locally, but keep in mind that you should not change or mess with the test.py files. 
		<p2><br>To run the tests, go on your terminal/command line, navigate to the hw folder and input python3 test_hw00.py. The test will then run and output your score.
