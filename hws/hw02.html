		<p>Instructions</p>
		<p2>Download <a href="../hw_zips/hw02.zip" download>hw02.zip</a>.</p2>
		<p2><br>Submission:</p2>
		<p2><br>Grading: Homework is graded based on effort, not correctness. However, there is no partial credit; you must show substantial effort on every problem to receive any points. This homework is out of 2 points. 
		</p2>
		<p>Homework Questions</p>

		<p2><br><b>Problem 1: Fibonacci Recursive</b></p2>
		<p2><br>Return the nth number of the fibonacci sequence using recursion! 

		<p2><br><br><b>Problem 2: Product</b></p2>
		<p2><br>Return the product of the first n terms in a sequence where n is a positive integer and term is a function that takes one argument.

		<p2><br><br><b>Problem 3: Repeated</b></p2>
		<p2><br>Return the function that computes the nth application of f.

		<p2><br><br><b>Problem 4: Triangle</b></p2>
		<p2><br>We have a triangle made of blocks. The topmost row has 1 block, the next row down has 2 blocks, the next row has 3 blocks, and so on. Compute recursively(no loops or multiplication) the total number of blocks in such a triangle with the given number of rows.


		<p>Testing</p>
		<p2><br>Testing will be done locally, but keep in mind that you should not change or mess with the test.py files. 
		<p2><br>To run the tests, go on your terminal/command line, navigate to the hw folder and input python3 test_hw00.py. The test will then run and output your score.
