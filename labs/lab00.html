	<div class="main">
		<p1><i>Due by Mon 1/6</i></p1>
		<p>Starter Files</p>
		<p2>Download <a href="../lab_zips/lab00.zip" download>lab00.zip</a>. Inside the archive, you will find starter files for the questions in this lab, along with a copy of the test files.</p2>
		<p><br>Submission</p>
		<p2>By the end of this lab, you should have submitted the lab with git. You may submit more than once, but only the final submission will be graded. Check that you have successfully submitted your code on git.</p2>
		<p><br>Introduction</p>
		<p2><br>This lab explains how to use your own computer to complete assignments for CS 61A, as well as introduce some of the basics of Python. If you are using a lab computer, most of the instructions are the same, except you won't have to install anything.<br><br>If you need any help at any time through the lab, please feel free to come to one of the TAs.<br><br>This lab looks really long, but it's mostly setup and learning how to use essential tools for this class; these may seem a bit difficult now, but it will quickly become second nature as we move further into the course.</p2>
		<p>Setup</p>

		<p2><br><b>Problem 1: Basic Arithmetic Functions</b></p2>
		<p2><br>Fill in the missing code for the functions add(),sub(),mul() and div(). <br>Run test_basic_arithmetic.py to test your code.</p2>

		<p2><br><br><b>Problem 2: Quick Maths</b></p2>
		<p2><br>Using the functions that you just implemented, fill in the missing blanks to solve the two following arithmetic equations quick_maths_one and quick_maths_two. <br>Run test_quick_maths.py to test your code.</p2>
